This is the new Blender integration addon for LuxCore.
Still in early development and completely unusable for end users.

### Developer Documentation

The doc folder contains the documentation.
* [Description of the project structure](https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/BlendLuxCore/blob/master/doc/project_structure.md)

To create a working BlendLuxCore that can be loaded into Blender, 
you first have to copy the LuxCore binaries into the bin folder.
See [bin/readme](https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/BlendLuxCore/blob/master/bin/readme.md) for more details.
